What a week, we are both super stressed and happy to get away from Amsterdam from few days. What a week. Usually we do early mornings flights out but this time we decided to opt for the afternoon flight, must say it was bit easier on our stress levels. 

I have been to Edinburgh before but can't really remember what we used to get to our accommodation, was a boys trip so valid excuse. On arrival at Edinburg we researched how to use the bus. You can scan QR code at airport to buy ticket but this didn't work for us, so we just referenced to Google maps and headed to the busses. You can buy your bus ticket at the bus station itself, very kind lady assisted us and we got on board. It was 8 pounds for return ticket, more than half the price of a taxi. We stayed on the western side of the city which is closer to airport, also find it less touristy. Few stops from airport we stop right in front of our accommodation The Roseate Edinburg, we look at each other amazed with the lucky find. The building looks beautiful and rustic from outside, really impressive. We are greeted by concierge which tells us all the stories from the pictures on the wall, clearly there is a lot of history in this place. He seems surprised that we will be here for 5 days, with Belinda's pocket guide she will make sure you get your daily steps in. Checked in, drop our bags and we head to city for dinner. 

The castle on hill is all light up in festive colours and in the city is in really festive vibe. We try few of our restaurants on our "want to go" list but we settle for something for simple. Found tourist trap bar which is not too full and we managed to get table. I have to listen very careful what the barman is saying with his Scottish accent but manage to order us some food and drinks. We were both starving so was really good, finish our beer and we head back to accommodation.

Wake up all refreshed, I decided to skip my run just to take it bit easier from all the stress past few days. Breakfast was included with the booking so there was no rush in morning to head out try and find spot, definitely recommended. We head out late afternoon, back to city. This time the streets bit more quiet compared to last night chaos on streets. We walk up to the Edinburgh castle and back down the royal mile, there so much going on on this mile so take your time and allow sufficient time. We reference to our booklet and see few stop we have to make, one of them being finding the Unicorn, Scotland's national animal, interesting. Close by you can also find JK Rowling's handprints, if you don't know Edinburgh architecture and scenes were her inspiration for the Harry Potters novels. 

We continue down the Royal Mile towards Holyrood Castle and by this time it is lunch already, we stop by great spot Outsiders, really lucky to find space. Book this in advance and ask for window spot. Once done we continue our walk down the Royal Mile towards Holyrood Castle. This is the castle that Mary the Queen of Scots stayed in and is also the castle where the Queen's courtier and private secretary was murdered, stabbed 56 times. Apparently you can still see the stains in the adjacent chamber of the supper room. We booked tickets for the castle on the day that we return, more on this later. We slowly head back, stop at pub for beer and flat cider, Belinda not impressed. By the time we got bit closer to our accommodation it was almost time for dinner, we picked the first place that look decent enough which was Fava, a Greek restaurant, good food, bit pricey but we enjoyed it. Day done and we head back to our accommodation, on route Belinda discovers biltong and Tesco, happy Belinda.
