Day 1:

What a week, we are both super stressed and happy to get away from Amsterdam from few days. What a week. Usually we do early mornings flights out but this time we decided to opt for the afternoon flight, must say it was bit easier on our stress levels. 

I have been to Edinburgh before but can't really remember what public transport we used to get to our accommodation, was a boys trip so valid excuse. On arrival at Edinburg we researched how to use the bus. You can scan QR code at airport to buy ticket but this didn't work for us, so we just referenced to Google maps and headed to the busses. You can buy your bus ticket at the bus station itself, very kind lady assisted us and we got on board. It was 8 pounds for return ticket, more than half the price of a taxi. We stayed on the western side of the city which is closer to airport, also find it less touristy. Few stops from airport we stop right in front of our accommodation The Roseate Edinburg, we look at each other amazed with the lucky find. The building looks beautiful and rustic from outside, really impressive. We are greeted by concierge which tells us all the stories from the pictures on the wall, clearly there is a lot of history in this place. He seems surprised that we will be here for 5 days, with Belinda's pocket guide she will make sure you get your daily steps in. Checked in, drop our bags and we head to city for dinner. 

The castle on hill is all light up in festive colours and in the city is in really festive vibe. We try few of our restaurants on our "want to go" list but we settle for something for simple. Found tourist trap bar which is not too full and we managed to get table. I have to listen very careful what the barman is saying with his Scottish accent but manage to order us some food and drinks. We were both starving so was really good, finish our beer and we head back to accommodation.

Day 2:

Wake up all refreshed, I decided to skip my run just to take it bit easier from all the stress past few days. Breakfast was included with the booking so there was no rush in morning to head out try and find spot, definitely recommended. We head out late afternoon, back to city. This time the streets bit more quiet compared to last night chaos. We walk up to the Edinburgh castle and back down the royal mile, there so much going on the mile so take your time and allow sufficient time. We reference to our booklet and see few stops we have to make, one of them being finding the Unicorn, Scotland's national animal, interesting. Close by you can also find JK Rowling's handprints, if you don't know Edinburgh architecture and scenes were her inspiration for the Harry Potters novels. 

We continue down the Royal Mile towards Holyrood Castle and by this time it is lunch already, we stop by great spot Outsiders, really lucky to find space. Book this in advance and ask for window spot. Once done we continue our walk down the Royal Mile towards Holyrood Castle. This is the castle that Mary the Queen of Scots stayed in and is also the castle where the Queen's courtier and private secretary was murdered, stabbed 56 times. Apparently you can still see the stains in the adjacent chamber of the supper room. We booked tickets for the castle on the day that we return, more on this later. We slowly head back, stop at pub for beer and flat cider, Belinda not impressed. By the time we got bit closer to our accommodation it was almost time for dinner, we picked the first place that look decent enough which was Fava, a Greek restaurant, good food, bit pricey but we enjoyed it. Day done and we head back to our accommodation, on route Belinda discovers biltong and Tesco, happy Belinda.

Day 3:

Christmas day, we woke up, enjoyed good breakfast and get ready for run to Cramond. Not sure what to expect, all we know is for the part we want to go to we must be sure it is low tide so we can get to Cramond Island. We take the Roseburn path, greeted and wish wished "Good morning, Merry Christmas" all along towards Cramond by fellow runners, walkers & cyclists. We arrive at Cramond amazed at the landscape and the causeway leading to the island. We cross to the island, take a few photos and head back. 

Everything is pretty much closed on Christmas day except the restaurants which we have booked in advance. We refer back to our booklet and find few walking trails, one of which is all along the Water of Leith. Everyone else seems to have the same idea. It is a beautiful walk, take your time, so much to see on the route. We end up walking all the way to Stockbridge. Since everything was closed we were not able to get something for lunch so end up just getting snacks from convenience store. It was getting dark so we decided to walk through the city back to our accommodation.

We made a reservation for dinner at Palatino, it was not our first choice. Since we got there we tried to get reservation at "Palmie", which is actually called The Palmerstone. Apparently you can get everything from head to tail there, not sure how I feel about it but the vibe seems nice, something on our list for next time. Moving on we arrive at Palatino, it is busy but everyone in good spirits. Belinda had the beef carpaccio for starters and reginette for mains and I had beetroot tartare for starters & haggis pizza for mains, easy good choice meal. We decide to skip desert and go to bar instead, can't resist not having whisky in Scotland. 

Day 4

We booked tour at 13:10 to see Mary's Close so we must be sure whatever plans we have we get there on time but first we going to do another walk, this time towards Arthur's seat. I was under impression we will just walk there and not go up there so I was dressed in informal long pants and my converse shoes, it required a bit of work and focus but it is doable, would just maybe recommend to dress in sport clothes and trainers. None the less it was beautiful view over Edinburgh when we got to the top. Still on the clock to be on time for Mary's Close we head back down towards the Royal Mile again for our tour, we must be there 10min before tour starts. Admiring the beautiful views as we head down we realise we took the longer route, not over the mountain but around. Picking up the pace, me stopping for pee break, Belinda heel-toe'ing (as she calls it) in front, me catching up again heel-toe'ing with her we arrived exactly at 13:00, hows that for planning.
